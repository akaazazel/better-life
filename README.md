### Project Description

[ On Nadan LinkedIn, whenever you post your achievements, they somehow get exaggerated in the eyes of everyone else‚Äîexcept you. It‚Äôs like living proof of the saying, ‚ÄúThe grass is always greener on the other side.‚Äù And of course, there‚Äôs always that option to share pictures for extra effect.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

[Since 95% of people exaggerate their achievements on LinkedIn, we built a site that does it automatically‚Äîbut with a twist: the exaggeration is visible to everyone except you.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

[Why work hard when " Nadan LinkedI " can over-exaggerate your posts without any middlemen? The twist‚Äîyour own posts look normal to you, but everyone else sees them turned up to eleven, and you get to see their feeds equally exaggerated.]
